# NIH Molecular Imaging Branch - Deep Learning Preprocessing Tools

This repository shares the preprocessing scripts we use at the Molecular Imaging Branch at the NIH. Depending on your raw data and your labels and annotations several preprocessing steps are needed before the Deep Learning models can be actually trained. This repository focuses mainly on computer vision tasks. Natural Language Processing tools are in planned.

## Contents

**1. VOI to Nifti mask conversion.** VOI is a file format created by the NIH software MIPAV (Medical Image Processing, Analysis and Visualization, https://mipav.cit.nih.gov/) mainly used for saving segmentations on DICOM images.

2. Nifti file anonymization
